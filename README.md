## About This Project:

This is an application where a user can submit a hamburger choice, and the "devour" it by clicking a button.

This was built with sql, express, node, handlebars, orm, Heroku, Javascript, HTML and CRUD methods.

## Summary of Project:

Opening the app brings the user to the "burger eating logger" homepage. Here, the user submits the name of the burger they would like to "order." The burger is added to the "Burger List" and a button is added for the user to click, and they would "eat" the burger.

The app uses get, post and put methods to add the burger to the list and update it to being "eaten."
